Urban Green - Shop Inventory System

This was my first solo project for the CodeClan Professional Software Development course. I built a web application that allows a shopkeeper to keep track of their stock. They can add, delete and edit stock and suppliers, display their inventory and see stock levels and the markup for each product.

I have uploaded the app to Heroku so you can view it at the below link:

## Original Brief

Shop Inventory
Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's inventory. This is not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop workers.

### MVP
* The inventory should track individual products, including a name, description, stock quantity, buying cost, and selling price.
* The inventory should track manufacturers, including a name and any other appropriate details.
* The shop can sell anything you like, but you should be able to create, edit and delete manufacturers and products separately.
* This might mean that it makes more sense for a car shop to track makes and models of cars. Or a bookstore might sell books by author, or by publisher, and not by manufacturer. You are free to name classes and tables as appropriate to your project.
* Show an inventory page, listing all the details for all the products in stock in a single view.
* As well as showing stock quantity as a number, the app should visually highlight "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user.

### Possible Extension
* Calculate the markup on items in the store, and display it in the inventory
